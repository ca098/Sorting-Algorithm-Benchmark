# DataGenerator
A Java command-line program, created for my research project that creates a list of jobs to be scheduled.
The current version of this program limits the amount of jobs created to 50,000. The jobs will be outputted
in a .txt file in the root directory of the program.

Program can be ran by navigating to the root directory and running Main.java

Example of the randomly generated schedules required for the ECTC, MaxUtil and BTC algorithms can be seen below.
These algorithms each require a set of resources to be homogeneous.

Outputted results are in the format:

task=0, arrival=0, processingTime=14, utilisation=20

task=1, arrival=4, processingTime=20, utilisation=60

task=2, arrival=8, processingTime=8, utilisation=40

task=3, arrival=11, processingTime=20, utilisation=70

task=4, arrival=18, processingTime=15, utilisation=60
